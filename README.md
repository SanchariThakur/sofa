# SOFA - SHARAD Open Focusing Attempt

SOFA is an experimental focuser for SHAllow RADar (SHARAD) radargrams written in python v3.

The focusing algorithm is inspired by the one developed and described by the U.S. SHARAD Science Team on the PDS Geosciences Node website (http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/mro/mro-m-sharad-5-radargram-v1/mrosh_2001/document/rgram_processing.pdf). SOFA algorithm extends those concepts by allowing the focusing of the radargram using a squint angle different from zero (i.e., squinted focusing), by using proper phase shifting.

Using this focuser it is possible to obtain new SHARAD products with possible better characteristics than those usually published on the PDS. Some applications are better documented on http://af-projects.it and the related code is available on this same repository.
